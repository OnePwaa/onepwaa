### 2018 Special Area | The Limitations of Social Media

Who knew that Facebook only acts in their interests and not for the public good?
Find out more in our fourth deep dive in the Limitations of Social Media!

There are multiple factors that make different forms of social media obsolete to
one another in some way. The following few are just some of the many factors
that limit the efficiency of said mediums, hence you are encouraged to do some
in depth research on your own so that you will be able to full grasp the
intricacies of the topic discussed.

**Letter Writing:**

- Arguably the least advanced and most obsolete form of social media to be
  applied in our globalized community
  - Difficulties in maintaining secrecy:
    - (Thought) Undeniably, hackers still exist as a threat to even the most
      secure emails sent via the internet, however, in contrast, transmission of
      data/information via physical means bears a significantly greater risk of
      having its contents exposed when we factor in confounding variables such
      as human error
  - Time- consuming
  - Lack of flexibility
  - Red- Tapism ( explore )

**E-mails:**

- One of, if not, the most prevalently used social medium when it comes to
  business-related agendas
  - Phishing
    - Sending and email whilst claiming to be from a legitimate company to
      extract personal information such as bank account numbers etc/
  - Internet is required
  - No guarantee that the email will be seen unless the user frequently accesses
    his/her account

**Facebook**

- Ease of spreading hoaxes
  - E.g. the Death of Rowan Atkinson, Dwayne the Rock Johnson’s Death, political
    related news
- Limited sharing options
  - Facebook does not allow the sharing of any articles, videos or photos
    outside of Facebook and hence greatly limits social interaction if it isn’t
    the go to social medium in a particular region

**Twitter**

- Messaging inefficiency
  - Twitter only allows for a person to send one direct message at a time. As
    compared to other forms of social media, this method of messaging in
    obsolete and can be seen as a limitation on Twitters social capacity
- Video posting is limited
  - Only the link to the video can be uploaded, not the actual video, hence its
    ability to spread information is greatly reduced

**Myspace** To understand its limitations, the best way to go about it is to
understand the causes of Myspace’s failure as a social networking site, and why
in 2008 it fell to the now-social-network heavyweight Facebook

- Cluttering of services
  - In its attempts to adapt a change in social networking needs and demands,
    Myspace made an attempt to make itself into an all-purpose site. However,
    this overambitious idea paired with improper and dysfunctional execution not
    only led the site to stray away from its core function, but also created a
    buggy and confusing interface for its users
- Anonymous Friends vs Friend Friends
  - Facebook’s system provided at the time a revolutionary innovation which was
    the ability to be friends with people you actually knew instead of unknown
    people from the internet

**Viber**

- Lack of flexibility
  - Viber users are only allowed to call other users with the Viber app on their
    phone
  - Only available on certain platforms i.e. BlackBerry, iOS, Android
- Reduced mobility
  - Greatly dependent on Wi-fi connection for free calls

**Tinder**

- The truest of oneself is concealed for the most part (though this can be
  prominent for other forms of social media as well)
  - Personality, predilections so on and so forth can be easily forged and
    considering that Tinder requires us to interact with complete strangers for
    the most part ( compare to social media like Facebook ) it is even more so
    unpredictable as to whether or not an individual truly intends to be honest
    with other users.

**Discord:**

- Privacy Issues
  - Discord policy: _Business Transfers: As we develop our business, we might
    sell or buy businesses or assets. In the event of a corporate sale, merger,
    reorganization, bankruptcy, dissolution or similar event, your information
    may be part of the transferred assets._
- Caters more to the gaming demographic
  - If we’re talking about general use, it does cater to the masses as a whole.
    Especially if it were to be used for business purposes as we’ve discussed in
    the bullet before this where Discord could potentially liquidize your
    information as assets to earn revenue

**Wechat:**

- More prominently used in Eastern Countries (predominant in China), less
  practical in Western countries
  - This could be attributed to the lack of focus given by Tencent towards
    integrating Wechat as a global social medium

- Services are either non-existent/ impractical in the international version of
  the app

**Vkontakte:**

- (Much like Wechat) lacks global application and is localised
