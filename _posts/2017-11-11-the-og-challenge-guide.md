### The OG Challenge Guide | Lexi Prichard

It’s everyone’s least favourite event, the 60 minutes of stress as you try to
remember that one thing you swore you wouldn't have to know but apparently you
now have to know: the CHALLENGE!!

I, like many other scholars, have a decidedly love-hate relationship with the
challenge. Although it’s an hour of agony, it’s an event I seem to do well in,
so I thought that for my first post on here I would talk about some of the
strategies I use in preparing for and taking that dreaded multi choice exam.

**120 questions. 1 hour. Challenge (accepted).**

so I thought that for my first post on here I would talk about some of the
strategies I use in preparing for and taking that dreaded multi choice exam.

(disclaimer: I am in no way experienced enough to offer foolproof advice, but
this is what works for me, and somehow managed to gain me a place in the top 10
senior challenge placings at this year’s toc????)

**STUDY (no, like actually study):**

One of the most basic pieces of advice I can give is to revise the listed
material. Whether you make 40 page research notes, or just find simple
definitions and explanations, a clear idea of the curriculum will help you make
more sense of the questions. I like to revise by making notes, then quizlets,
questions, and practice papers as the season goes on.

**USE YOUR TEAM:**

Every scholar seems to be incredibly busy, meaning that fitting in WSC study can
be a hard task. To help combat this, each member of our team took 2 subjects and
researched these in detail. We then swapped our notes, making quizlets, practice
challenge papers, and quizzing each other on the subjects we hadn't yet covered.
This way, we all ended up knowing each of the subjects in reasonable detail,
while saving time and helping us work together as a team!

**LINK WSC TO SCHOOL:**

If you have an open ended project or a research paper due, take a topic from the
WSC curriculum and write your paper on that! It’s the best form of multitasking
and means you can quite literally do two things at once.

**USE IMAGES:**

Take one scroll through my notes from this past season and you’ll find photos
littered throughout every page. I find that incorporating things like images
(memes ;) or epithets into my research makes it more fun, and means I’m way more
likely to remember it when I need to.

**THE MORE THE MERRIER:**

Quite simply, the more you look over your notes, the more likely you are to know
them. While painfully obvious, glancing at your research every day on the bus/in
the bath/at dinner/in class really helps get it into your head. If you really
want to know your stuff, make sure your notes are detailed. For some topics, I
had a page or two of research for each listed heading, but others I only had
like,,,, 2 bullet points because it was boring (or Wikipedia didn't have it) so
just do what feels right!!

**ON THE DAY:**

- Get enough sleep! (aka no insomnia cookies the night before the challenge)
  **(Editor's note: but I love Insomnia cookies Lexiiii)**
- Drink enough water, eat a good breakfast, etc etc
- Don’t stress too much!! Take it easy, relax, and have fun with your friends
- Make sure you have a bubble-shading strategy, and stick to it- are you going
  to be confident and shade one bubble per question? Or did you forget to revise
  and might just do all 5?
- Some people like to start with the questions they know (hahahah does anyone
  know anything on the challenge tho??), and others like to do it completely
  opposite! I generally just move through the paper in chronological order in
  case I forget to go back over it
- Manage your time so that you answer every question, and have time to check
  over anything you missed

That’s about all from me!
