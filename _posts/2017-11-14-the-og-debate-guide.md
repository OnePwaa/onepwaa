### The OG Debate Guide

Struggling with debating? Wanting some helpful tips? Take a look and see what
our team has to say:

**Define key terms in the motion.**

- Using these definitions, show how your side provides more benefit to
  individuals & society.

**Tell the judge & opponents the key points you need to prove to win the
debate.**

- Prove that you hold the moral high ground over your opponents.
- Prove that your arguments can be applied more efficiently in status quo.

**[WSC Debate Scoresheet](https://www.dropbox.com/s/pkl3n11swsgf7xt/DebateScoresheet.pdf?dl=0)**

Look at the scoresheet! There are so many points up for grabs if you do some
things others almost never do. It is difficult to score thousands of people
engaged in subjective debate, but follow this guide & you will make the most of
the impwaafect scoring system. Remember, the scores never lie. It is up to you
to win for yourself.

**Motions**

WSC motions are the bane of my existence with their tendency to completely not
support high-level case framework.

Junior motions are often more quirky/less serious, leaning towards the absurd,
while Senior motions (esp. in Yale) are more current issues/policy-oriented,
with implications for the status quo. As usual, the most useful advice I can
offer is to read stuff like the New York Times & The Economist to keep up with
current issues in the socio-economic spectrum.

For example, Yale 2016 had the motion "Facebook should ban fake news" - while
not in the official syllabus, it had implications for the stuff we were studying
in An Imperfect World.

**Feedback**

Proper feedback produces debate medals. Judges are tired of listening to
compliments aimed at being "polite". Instead, use the time provided to analyse
the opponent's points & help them come up with better argument styles. Show the
judge that you are worthy of 7 points in feedback by producing proper analysis
of the scenarios & how they can improve themselves. Just don't try to undermine
their points & you will be polite enough!

**Teamwork**

Discuss during prep. Seriously, do not go off & write your own points down
without consulting your teammates. Spend 5-10 mins whispering to each other - I
promise you will score higher in everything.

**Style & Content**

Study my notes for content, but do not use evidence from Art & Literature, even
if the judge is DAA (which shows they know the syllabus enough to coach others).
Or else you would be having hell for trying to incorporate deep symbolism into
policy debate. It is best for you to **develop your own style**, though Juniors
benefit from being louder, because judges are looking for confidence more than
analysis & content in young pacas. For Seniors, especially for those going to
Yale, judges are looking for more cohesion e.g. more poised methods of
delivering your content - like the one I gave you below.

**Define key terms in the motion.**

- Using these definitions, show how your side provides more benefit to
  individuals & society.

**Tell the judge & opponents the key points you need to prove to win the
debate.**

- Prove that you hold the moral high ground over your opponents.

- Prove that your arguments can be applied more efficiently in status quo.

**Frame arguments and team stance into case context.**

- Back up your team stance with arguments that provide solutions to the problems
  posed.
- This allows you to apply both constructive & destructive approaches to the
  debate.

**Rebut the opposition by turning their arguments into your favour.**

- This generates clash issues where both sides are not in consensus.
- Show how your side provides better solutions & outcomes to specific scenarios
  within the debate.
