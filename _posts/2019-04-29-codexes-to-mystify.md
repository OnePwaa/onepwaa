### Codexes to Mystify!

Ever been stuck between two people that speak a language you don’t? Often deemed
an alternate “third-wheeling” experience, such is both confusing and, at times,
painful.

In this deep dive, we explore “languages” that leave the majority of us
bewildered, along with manuscripts and other documents that have yet to be
understood.

**_Rohonc Codex:_**

The Rohonc Codex (often spelled Rohonczi) is an illustrated manuscript book by
an unknown author that was found in Hungary in the early 19th century. The
origin and the meaning of the text and illustrations have been investigated by
many scholars and amateurs with no definitive conclusion. Many Hungarian
scholars believe that it is an 18th-century hoax. The mysterious book was kept
in Rohonoc until 1838, when it was donated to the Hungarian Academy of Sciences
by Gusztáv Batthyány. The writing may be Sumero-Hungarian, Daco-Romanian (part
of the old Hungarian alphabet), or Brahmi-Hindi.

A strictly methodical (and successful) investigation of the symbols was first
done in 1970 by Ottó Gyürk. He examined repeated sequences to find the direction
of writing, with pages also ordered right-to-left, and identified numbers in the
text. After careful investigation, he noted that the code is most likely read
from right to left and top to bottom, also known as the RLTB method.

**_The Voynich Manuscript:_**

The Voynich Manuscript has been a subject of considerable controversy among
researchers and historians. It is composed of 120 parchment folios (leaves), 18
of which is missing. With an extensive range of illustrations and an
indecipherable script, the Manuscript is yet to be decoded, and its exact
history remains elusive.

Although not definitively confirmed by any studies, the creation of the Voynich
Manuscript was likely in the first half of the fifteenth century.
[Carbon-dating](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/6-things-know-about-mysterious-voynich-manuscript-180964847/)
of certain folios consistently suggests that the script was written between 1404
and 1438.
[Other tests](http://web.archive.org/web/20181029211234/http:/www.voynich.nu/origin.html),
including (1) the protein analysis of the calf skin used to make the parchments
and the (2) studies on the inks and pigments of the Manuscript concurred with
the conclusion above. Other opinions exist, too; American botanists Janick and
Tucker argued that the script
[could not be created before 1492](https://www.purdueexponent.org/campus/article_add82e4e-b459-11e8-9216-af724f8f4781.html),
citing the appearance of certain flora and fauna that characterizes the
post-Columbian period.

Regarding the location of origin, many schools of thought also emerged. Among
these are guesses ranging from the tentative, such as Yale researchers’
[‘Central Europe’](https://beinecke.library.yale.edu/collections/highlights/voynich-manuscript)
remark to a pinpointed location, including
[Verona, Italy](http://web.archive.org/web/20181029211234/http:/www.voynich.nu/origin.html)
(inferring from the appearance of
[crenellations](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/crenellation) common in northern
Italy), Germany, or Puebla.

Currently, the ownership of the Manuscript belongs to the
[Beinecke Rare Book & Manuscript Library at Yale University](https://beinecke.library.yale.edu/collections/highlights/voynich-manuscript)
in the United States - which also made a
[public, free digital copy](http://brbl-dl.library.yale.edu/vufind/Record/3519597)
of the Manuscript. It has had a long history with many different owners. Holy
Roman Emperor Rudolf II might have been
[the first owner](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Voynich-manuscript) of this
Manuscript, who allegedly purchased it from John Dee.
[This account was supported](http://nabataea.net/vhistory.html) by the letter of
Johannes Marcus Marci, who wrote to Georg Baresch. A few transfers later, in
1912, Polish-American scientist Wilfrid Voynich -- the namesake of the
Manuscript -- purchased it from Jesuit College in Italy. He was adamant about
solving the mystery of the Manuscript, as with the many prominent scientists
that spent their efforts deciphering the ‘Voynichese language’. Despite having
patterns similar to known languages, the Manuscript is yet to be meaningfully
translated merely by replacing with Latin characters. More interestingly,
[a code was probably used](https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/1/16959454/voynich-manuscript-mystery-ai-decoded-debunked)
on top of the language, complicating the search for an answer.

If the history of the Voynich Manuscript is intriguing and bizarre, its contents
are equally as mind-boggling, perhaps even more. The writing in the Manuscript
seems to be in an indecipherable language to which we aren’t familiar to yet.
Apart from the writing, each page seems to be accompanied by drawings of
unfamiliar herbs, astrological symbols and even bathing women; all drawn in
washes of ink.

The drawings of the Voynich Manuscript can be divided into six basic categories:
(1) Botanicals containing drawings of up to 113 unidentified plant species (2)
Astrological drawings including astral charts, suns and moons and Zodiac symbols
(3) A biological section with images of nude females with swollen abdomens
bathing in various fluids with interconnecting pipelines (4) An array of nine
cosmological medallions (5) Pharmaceutical drawings of medicinal herbs and roots
(6)Continuous texts which seem to be recipes

Historians and cryptographers for years have been baffled by the mysterious text
and the illustrations, giving rise to numerous theories one of which includes
the fact that maybe the script was a hoax created by Voynich himself. However,
history researcher, Nicholas Gibbs, believes that he’s cracked the code behind
the elusive manuscript. Gibbs believes that maybe the manuscript is basically a
guide to women’s health that's mostly plagiarized from other guides of the era.
After analyzing the code for a while, Gibbs realized that the words were
medieval Latin abbreviations which he had seen in medical treatises for herbs.

**_Kryptos_**

Kryptos, the Greek word for “hidden,” defines the CIA’s role as an intelligence
agency. At their headquarters in Langley, Virginia, stands a sculpture with 4
huge copper plates. Unveiled on September 3rd, 1990 with the help of Ed Scheidt,
the former Chairman of the CIA Cryptographic Center, the sculpture comes as a
challenge to the most intelligent people in the USA. There are supposedly clues
surrounding the Kryptos that help solve the puzzle, and while 3 of the 4 codes
have been deciphered, the last remains a mystery.

![](https://onepwaa.weebly.com/uploads/4/5/7/8/45782123/5_orig.png)

It was previously thought that William Webster, the CIA Director at the time the
sculpture was revealed, also held the solution to the code. However, such a fact
was later denied.

The first code is a simple one, meant for for cryptographers, and uses the
Vigenere Cipher. It translates to a particularly poignant poetic phrase:
“BETWEEN SUBTLE SHADING AND THE ABSENCE OF LIGHT LIES THE NUANCE OF IQLUSION”
The misspelling of illusion is almost certainly intentional, as it supposedly
reflects on how Sanborn admits when he makes mistakes.

The second code is tougher, but uses the same method of encryption. Its message,
however, is a lot more interesting. It hints at something buried, and was
corrected throughout the years

“IT WAS TOTALLY INVISIBLE HOWS THAT POSSIBLE ? THEY USED THE EARTHS MAGNETIC
FIELD X THE INFORMATION WAS GATHERED AND TRANSMITTED UNDERGRUUND TO AN UNKNOWN
LOCATION X DOES LANGLEY KNOW ABOUT THIS ? THEY SHOULD ITS BURIED OUT THERE
SOMEWHERE X WHO KNOWS THE EXACT LOCATION ? ONLY WW THIS WAS HIS LAST MESSAGE X
THIRTY EIGHT DEGREES FIFTY SEVEN MINUTES SIX POINT FIVE SECONDS NORTH SEVENTY
SEVEN DEGREES EIGHT MINUTES FORTY FOUR SECONDS WEST X LAYER TWO”

The last few words were originally deciphered as "FOUR SECONDS WEST ID BY ROWS",
but Sanborn later corrected it to "...FOUR SECONDS WEST X LAYER TWO.”

The third code was cracked through the method of transposition and spelled out
an extract from the diary of Howard Carter, particularly regarding the discovery
of the tomb of King Tutankhamen. It reads:

“SLOWLY DESPARATLY SLOWLY THE REMAINS OF PASSAGE DEBRIS THAT ENCUMBERED THE
LOWER PART OF THE DOORWAY WAS REMOVED WITH TREMBLING HANDS I MADE A TINY BREACH
IN THE UPPER LEFT HAND CORNER AND THEN WIDENING THE HOLE A LITTLE I INSERTED THE
CANDLE AND PEERED IN THE HOT AIR ESCAPING FROM THE CHAMBER CAUSED THE FLAME TO
FLICKER BUT PRESENTLY DETAILS OF THE ROOM WITHIN EMERGED FROM THE MIST X CAN YOU
SEE ANYTHING Q ?”

The fourth and final code is still to be discovered, and the most recent clue
explains that the last two words of the code spell ‘Berlin Clock’, referencing
the ‘Mengenlehreuhr’, the first public clock in the world.

However, it is also shrouded in mystery, as its designer - Dieter Binninger -
mysteriously died in 1991, uncomfortably close to the unveiling of Kryptos.
