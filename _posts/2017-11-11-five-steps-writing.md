### 5 Steps to Writing Success | Darren Tan

Get the intro right. Nothing else matters if they can't consistently put up a great hook that will attract the eyes of the WSC staff. Don't start on other aspects of writing until the entire delegation can write a good intro.

The best writers never use the internet for content - they use their brain. Notice that you can't apply knowledge without studying beforehand, so really do that - the top scholars aren't that smart, they just work twice as hard as everybody else.

Hey guys, much of the content on OnePwaa comes when we are helping scholars. So please feel free to contact us! Recently I have received dozens of emails and PMs from scholars who were confused about how to begin their efforts towards becoming better writers. Below is my most comprehensive answer which I decided to share with everyone:

*Thanks for asking me not to rush, I really appreciated that as I'm sooo busy - and it also gave me time to devise more specific training strategy for you. I coach scholars sometimes in Penang so I hope I am able to help out! I understand that your delegation just started training, so here's 5 steps to success:*

1. Simplest steps first: have them read & understand the WSC marking system for essays. This will help shape their essay structure. Click to "WSC Essay Rubric" here: https://onepwaa.weebly.com/strategy.html#writing

2. The PEEL (Point, Evidence, Explain, Link) template is always a sure go to maintain consistency among your delegation! If they can work well with it, go ahead and use it to maximize your rate of medals. The key is that you have to be concise when doing it, or it will fall apart. PEEL is an amazing method that can win medals for sure - it's just that it may come off as boring, stiff, formal, uncreative, etc which may make it more difficult to stand out. To avoid this, it is important to use more powerful phrases while being really concise at the same time - this conveys a short but strong message to the reader. To get those phrases, look for professional analysis of the art & literature works online when studying - it works wonders for describing the theory behind your arguments.

3. Get the intro right. Nothing else matters if they can't consistently put up a great hook that will attract the eyes of the WSC staff. Don't start on other aspects of writing until the entire delegation can write a good intro.

4. Most of all, WSC is about self-enrichment through collaborative learning. Allow them to develop their own writing rituals! Experiment with training activities! Tip: do an essay competition instead of framing it as homework (even I won't do homework for WSC). You can also get them to debate with their written essays -  WSC style writing is really about showing that you can apply your knowledge and expanding on it with your own thoughts and sentiments. The best writers never use the internet for content - they use their brain. Notice that you can't apply knowledge without studying beforehand, so really do that - the top scholars aren't that smart, they just work twice as hard as everybody else.

5. These are only basic tips! To truly improve anyone's writing significantly, you must get them to read & write consistently, because practice and experience are the two most important training aspects of WSC. For what to do throughout the writing event, I recommend Tracy Huang's blog post on OnePwaa. She's a far better writer than me, having graduated from the New York University School of Law and started her own freelance writing business, dawritespace.com. See it here on her blog.

As for your submission, you can send it to me in a Word document or PDF file. Thanks for being willing to share what you have to other scholars!! :)) It takes a long time for me to roll out site updates though, so please bear with me for a few weeks!

Wow, that was long. I'm gonna convert these tips into a writing guide for beginners! Also, thanks for reaching out to us at OnePwaa, it feels great to make a difference for other scholars!
