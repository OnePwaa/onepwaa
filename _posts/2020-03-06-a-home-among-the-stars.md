title: Science | Carving Ourselves a Home Among the Stars
---

​Humans have always been fascinated by the mysteries of outer space. Some like to think that we are in control of everything—that we were born on this habitable planet for a reason, a purpose. Others believe that Earth is nothing more than a pale, blue dot. It is minuscule and we are not as significant as we think we are. Earth is but a speck of dust. It plays a small role in the grand scheme of things. The more we discover, the more we believe that this is true. Our universe is vast and wide. This means that lots of exploring is yet to be done. 

In this deep dive, we’ll take a look at our various ventures into unknown territory. We discover what it means to be curious about concepts in science that are indefinite. We discover things about outer space.

### Relevant Terms 

#### Outer Space Treaty:


The Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, including the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies, alternatively known by its shorter name, the Outer Space Treaty, is a 1967 treaty regarded as the foundational agreement for international space law.

[The Treaty stipulates](https://www.unoosa.org/oosa/en/ourwork/spacelaw/treaties/introouterspacetreaty.html), among other provisions, that:

1. celestial bodies are open to exploration and scientific research by all countries, on condition that such actions have “peaceful purposes” (Art. I, IV). 

2. the act of countries claiming jurisdiction over celestial bodies, as well as launching into orbit weapons of mass destruction or devices carrying nuclear weaponry, shall not be allowed (Art II, IV).

3. countries should promote the spirit of international cooperation in matters of common interest, and in assisting astronauts in distress.

4. individual countries have ownership of the devices they launched into space, and are responsible for compensation should those devices cause destruction in outer space.

[Prior to the signing of the Treaty](https://2009-2017.state.gov/t/isn/5181.htm), in 1965-6, the US and USSR both submitted drafts for the agreement. The former paid specific attention to governance of celestial bodies, while the latter was concerned about the whole outer space environment. With the merging work completed by the Legal Subcommittee of the UN Committee on the Peaceful Use of Outer Space (COPUOS), in December 1956, the completed treaty was presented before the UN as Resolution 2222 (XXI). It came into force after nine months of opening for signatures in three cities, Washington D.C., Moscow, and London. To date, over 100 countries and territories have signed this Treaty.

In its 50-year existence, the Treaty has inspired multiple follow-up treaties and conventions. However, with the monumental developments in space technology, the rise of private space exploration companies, and the relative flexibility of the provisions, reservations are being voiced about the Treaty’s adaptability to our current times.

#### MarsOne:


MarsOne was a private Dutch company (founded in 2011) that received money from investors claiming that it would be used to land the first humans on Mars and leave them there to establish a permanent human colony. However, MarsOne is now known as a ‘scam’ in the media.

Before the company was terminated, the whole ideology of the company was criticized by many scientists, engineers and members in the aerospace industry stated that there were many medical and logistic concerns; and the company was lacking critical concepts about their hardware. There was even an investigation done by MIT producing a report that within 68 days, the first settlers would suffocate and die. The media had deemed that this concept was a ‘suicide mission’. 

Why was it a ‘scam’? In order for ‘contestants’ to get to the next round, they would either have to invest in the company or buy merchandise from MarsOne (states Dr. Joseph Roche). Furthermore, the company did not have enough funds in the first place. They kept looking for investors and received 1 million USD from donations. The company even intended to turn the selection into a reality TV show - thankfully, this did not happen. The plan for the 100 settlers was this:

“Once they arrive on Mars, the astronauts will begin making use of their relatively spacious living units; over 50 m2 per person, and a total of more than 200 m2 combined interior space.
Within the settlement are inflatable components which contain bedrooms, working areas, a living room and a 'plant production unit', where they will grow greenery. They will also be able to shower as normal, prepare fresh food (that they themselves grew and harvested) in the kitchen, wear regular clothes, and, in essence, lead typical day-to-day lives.” - MarsOne
However, on the 15th of January (2019), a court decision was settled - they would liquidate the organisation, bankrupting it in the process.
